Express is a library that we installed by running
npm install express --save
in the terminal. It is located in the node_modules folder.
Express makes our job of writing a node server much easier by
providing shortcuts for many of the tasks that would otherwise
take a lot of code to complete.

typeof(express) == "function"

We call the express function to create a new "Express App"

We're going to configure this app to handle the requests the
way that we want.

	process.env.PORT is an environment (system) variable
